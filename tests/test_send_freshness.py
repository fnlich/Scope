"""Signature freshness: a request must not be signed before it can be sent.

Epistula stamps a wall-clock timestamp at signing and miners reject anything
outside an eight-second window. Signing therefore starts a clock that the
connection setup, the event loop, and any queueing in front of the miner all
spend. Under a wide fan-out the earliest-signed requests can reach the wire long
after their timestamps, and are rejected as replays despite being genuine.

The fix is to sign only once a send slot is held, and to give that slot back the
moment the body reaches the transport — not when the miner finishes thinking. A
miner is allowed to take the full solve deadline; it must not hold a send slot
for that whole time.

Two properties here are about the mechanism failing safely rather than about the
feature working:

  * the slot count must return exactly to its starting value after any mix of
    successes, connection failures and timeouts. A leaked slot shrinks capacity
    until dispatch deadlocks; a doubly-returned slot raises the ceiling, so the
    limit silently stops limiting and the original defect returns under load.
  * the request must stay byte-identical on the wire. Streaming a body to learn
    when it is consumed switches HTTP framing from Content-Length to chunked
    unless the length is set explicitly, and that reaches every miner.
