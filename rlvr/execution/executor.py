"""Sandbox executor contract.

An `Executor` runs candidate code against a `Problem`'s hidden tests in an
ISOLATED sandbox and reports one `ExecutionResult` per test. The contract is
intentionally narrow so the verifier can treat any backend identically.

Backends:
  - SubprocessExecutor: development-only process isolation with resource limits.
    It blocks network on macOS when sandbox-exec is available, but not on Linux.
  - DockerExecutor: same contract, inside a `python:3.12-slim` container with
    `--network=none` and mem/cpu limits.

Comparison semantics (shared by all backends): structural equality with a
float tolerance of 1e-6 (see `rlvr.execution.compare.values_equal`).
