"""Time- and count-bounded score histories -> L1-normalized weights.

Design choices:
  - Each uid retains at most ``max_samples`` payments from the latest
    ``window_seconds`` when a new observation arrives.
  - Scores divide by at least ``min_samples``, preventing one lucky first answer
    from immediately receiving a full score while allowing a fuller window to
    reduce the impact of one transient miss.
  - Only completed challenges advance histories. Non-serving miners receive one
    zero per completed challenge, never for server pacing or empty rounds.
    Set ``decay=False`` to freeze histories on silence.
  - Deregistration is handled by :meth:`sync`: when a uid's hotkey changes the slot
    belongs to a NEW miner, so its inherited history is reset. Hotkeys are tracked
    per uid as they are observed (via :meth:`update` or :meth:`set_hotkeys`).
  - The score vector can GROW if the metagraph adds UIDs (e.g. after a sync), and
    :meth:`get_weights` can be aligned to a provided metagraph size ``n`` so the
    weight vector length matches what ``set_weights`` expects.
  - Everything is nan-safe: nan/inf scores are treated as 0 before normalization,
    and an all-zero score vector yields all-zero weights (not nan).
